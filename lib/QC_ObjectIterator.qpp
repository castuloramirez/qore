//! This class a basic iterator class for objects
/** Call ObjectIterator::next() to iterate through the object; do not use the iterator if ObjectIterator::next() returns @ref False.
    An object can be iterated in reverse order by calling ObjectIterator::prev() instead of ObjectIterator::next()

    @note
    - In general, the ObjectIterator class is not designed to be accessed from multiple threads; it was created without locking for
      fast and efficient use when used from a single thread.  For methods that would be unsafe to use in another thread, any use of
      such methods in threads other than the thread where the constructor was called will cause an \c ITERATOR-THREAD-ERROR to be thrown.
