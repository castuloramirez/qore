   FIXME: commit()s when autocommit=true should be made here, also after
          select()s (in case of a select for update, for example)

   FIXME: when raising an timeout exception there is a race condition
          getting the TID of the thread holding the lock, because the lock 
	  could have been released after the ::enter() call fails... but it's
	  only cosmetic (for the exception text)
