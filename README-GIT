to rebuild qore from subversion, the following tools are required:
* automake 1.9 (or better)
* autoconf 2.59 (or better)
* libtool 1.5.10 or better (possibly earlier versions of libtool will work depending on your platform - I cannot get qore to build on Darwin with libtool versions earlier than 1.5.10 from fink)

** NOTE that you may need GNU m4 1.4.4 or better; this may be dependent on automake or autoconf; I was not able to build qore from subversion on Darwin with the supplied m4 1.4.2

if these dependencies are met, then execute ./reconf.sh in the current directory, which will build the configure file
then you can:
./configure
make
make install

as usual...

** NOTE: now that qore has stable API and ABIs, modules have been moved to separate git repos; you can find module source here:
