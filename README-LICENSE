The qore library is released under the GPL and LGPL.  

This has been done in order to continue to allow qore to be used in closed-source programs, but to allow use of third-party GPL libraries for open-source programs using the qore library.

The library must be initialized with a parameter indicating under which license the library will be used.
When the library is initialized under the LGPL license, modules requiring the GPL license (ex: the qt modules) cannot be loaded.

Closed-source programs may not initialize the library using the GPL license, as this would be a violation of the GPL license which does not allow linking with closed-source programs.
