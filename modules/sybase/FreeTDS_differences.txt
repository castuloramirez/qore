FreeTDS 0.64 (stable) connected to a local Sybase 15.0 server
has different behavior to native CT library:

* MONEY and MONEY4 conversions into double
  incorrectly round the float number.
  See conversions_tests.cc.

* cs_locale(CS_SYB_CHARSET) returns empty string
  as the default encoding (CT library returns "utf8").
  See encoding_helpers_tests.cc. 
  Setting it and reading it again doesn't help.
