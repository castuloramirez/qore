  <title>Appendix B: Known Bugs</title>

  <para>Out of memory errors are not always captured. Internal support for trapping these conditions in the C++ <command>new</command> operator must be developed.</para>

  <para>The MySQL driver doesn't support stored procedure execution yet.</para>

  <para>XML serialization needs to be improved regarding repeating elements (lists) while preserving order, interfaces need to be sanitized.</para>

  <para>date and time handling need to be sanitized, particulary regarding relative and absolute dates &amp; date arithmetic.</para>

  <para>parse option implementation needs to be fixed to prohibit access to classes which provide access to restricted features.  Currently even if, for example <code>PO_NO_NETWORK</code> is set, the Socket and FtpClient classes are available.  Also the documentation needs to be updated providing details about which functions/features are not available when parse options are set.</para>
