 NamedScopes are children of a program object.  there is a parse
 lock per program object to ensure that objects are added (or backed out)
 atomically per program object.  All the objects referenced here should 
 be safe to read & copied at all times.  They will only be deleted when the
 program object is deleted (except the pending structures, which will be
			    deleted any time there is a parse error, together with all other
			    pending structures)
