//! class used to safely manipulate the system environment
/** On some platforms (HP-UX for example), the system environment cannot be accessed
    safely from multiple threads without a lock.  This class guarantees thread-safe
    access to the environment on all systems (as long as all accesses are made through
    this class).  There is only one of the objects; the constructor and destructor are
    not exported in the public interface of the library and therefore can only be 
    instantiated internally anyway.
    To make multiple updates atomically within the environment lock, use AtomicEnvironmentSetter
