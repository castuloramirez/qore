************************
Qore Library Source Code
************************
The qore library is released under three open-source licenses: the GPL, LGPL, 
and MIT license.  

This has been done in order to continue to allow qore to be used in
closed-source programs, but to allow use of third-party GPL libraries for
open-source programs using the qore library.

The library must be initialized with a parameter indicating under which
license the library will be used.

When the library is initialized under the LGPL or MIT licenses, modules
requiring the GPL license (ex: the mysql module) cannot be loaded.

Closed-source programs may not initialize the library using the GPL license,
as this would be a violation of the GPL license which does not allow linking
with closed-source programs.


*************************
User Modules and Examples
*************************
User modules and examples delivered with Qore are released under the MIT
license; see each source file for the full text of the license
