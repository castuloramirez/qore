 The Datasource class provides the low-level interface to Qore DBI drivers.
 
 NOTE that this class is *not* thread-safe.  To use this class in a multi-
 threaded context, per-thread connection locking must be done at a level
 above this class...
 
 NOTE that 2 copies of connection values are kept in case
 the values are changed while a connection is in use
