  NamedScopes are children of a program object.  there is a parse
  lock per program object to ensure that objects are added (or backed out)
  atomically per program object.  All the objects referenced here should 
  be safe to read & copied at all times.  They will only be deleted when the
  program object is deleted (except the pending structures, which will be
  deleted any time there is a parse error, together with all other
  pending structures)
